# BlackCatDesigns Portfolio Project Overview

## 1. Project Basics
- **Project Name:** BlackCatDesigns Portfolio
- **Tagline:** "Showcasing my skills, projects, and journey of tinkering with technology"
- **Tech Stack:** React, Next.js, Once UI components, Tailwind CSS
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo approach for easy maintenance

## 2. Vision Statement
To create a professional online presence that showcases my development skills, design aesthetic, and project portfolio, ultimately helping me connect with potential employers and clients who value my approach to development and design. The site will serve as both a living resume and a technical playground to demonstrate my capabilities.

## 3. Problem Statement
As a developer, I need a centralized platform to showcase my work, skills, and story to potential employers and clients. Existing solutions either lack customization options or require too much technical knowledge to maintain. Additionally, keeping portfolio sites updated often becomes burdensome, resulting in outdated representations of skills and projects.

## 4. Solution
Using the Once UI starter kit, I'll create a responsive, visually appealing portfolio that highlights my projects, skills, and experience. The Once UI components will allow me to quickly build a professional site while maintaining the flexibility to customize it to reflect my personal brand.

**Once UI Implementation:**
- Leverage the Once UI theming system to create a consistent visual identity
- Use Once UI's Card, Button, and Navigation components for core interface elements
- Implement Once UI's responsive grid system for layout management
- Utilize Once UI's form components for the contact section
- Implement dark/light mode toggle using Once UI's theme switcher

## 5. Target Audience
- **Primary:** Potential employers, clients, and collaborators in different industries
- **Secondary:** Fellow developers interested in my open-source projects or technical blog posts
- **Tertiary:** Design enthusiasts looking for web design inspiration

## 6. Success Metrics
