ColorPicker

Web-based app to help users choose different color combos. A pallette generator.

The interface should allow the user to 
- generate a new palette with a button (using logic that chooses colors that work well together)
- 'lock' a color so that it doesn't change when randomly generating
- 'add' a new color slot to the palette
- favorite a color. (Saving it so it persists reloads)
- save an entire color palette
